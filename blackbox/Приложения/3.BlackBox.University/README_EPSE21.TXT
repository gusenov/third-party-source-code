Package version 1.0, date 02 March 2004.

This package of software for Blackbox Component Builder from Oberon microsystems (www.oberon.ch) 
as a quick introduction into programming in Blackbox for a physicist/engineer.

Installation:

0) Close Blackbox if it is running.

1) Backup the Blackbox directory where Blackbox was originally installed
(default: C:\Programs Files\Blackbox\).

2) Unzip all these files and subdirectories into the Blackbox directory, overwriting the original files.

Now when Blackbox is started, a map to the provided documents will be open automatically (it contains instructions how to disable this).

The package contains a number of simple introductory examples,
several useful subsystems:
	Datafit -- 1D data fitting;
	Lib -- a library of math functions;
	Plot -- 2D graphs;
	also: Babel, Ctls, Util with disabled menus to reduce menu clutter (to enable, remove minuses from names of the corresponding files).

The package also contains a port of Lepage's Vegas with an example of use.

The package also provides instructions for interfacing Blackbox programs with the outside world via DLLs.

Enjoy!
